## Troubleshooting

If attendees have difficulty scanning the QR codes:

1. Ensure adequate lighting
2. Suggest they use their device's native camera app, which typically includes QR scanning
3. Have the direct URL available as a backup: https://ulgwvahq.manus.space
4. Consider having a few devices pre-loaded with the site for those who may have technical difficulties

These QR codes provide a seamless way for Impact10X judges and attendees to experience your DataSovereign MVP firsthand during your presentation.
